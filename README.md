# smtpro
A simple email automation utility

For first time users, run the SMTPro_Setup.py, it will generate the required folders and template files for use.

If you need to modify the config you could do so by either rerunning the setup script, or by modifying the .yaml file in the config folder.

For now this utility is mainly for sending invoices out via Email without needing to use a paid software like Mailchimp or anything more advanced than that.

I'll add more to this README overtime as I make changes and think of better ways of explaining how to use the utility.
